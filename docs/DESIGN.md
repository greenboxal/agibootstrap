# AGIBootstrap Technical Design Document
AGIBootstrap is a fully autonomous general-purpose coder AI agent that is designed to replace any human coder. This document provides a world-class design document with a full description of the system, its components, and how they interact.
## Components
AGIBootstrap consists of the following major components:
### Codex
The codex package provides functionality for managing projects in Go. It includes version control, code analysis, and code generation capabilities.
### PSI
The psi package provides a graph-based representation of a file directory system. It focuses on code files and allows for efficient manipulation and analysis of the structure.
### FTI
The fti package is responsible for indexing file-based repositories using embedding vectors. It provides fast and efficient search capabilities for code repositories.
## Supported Languages
AGIBootstrap currently supports the following languages:
- Golang
- Markdown
## Future Plans
In the future, AGIBootstrap aims to expand its language support to include more programming languages. It also plans to enhance its code generation capabilities by incorporating advanced natural language processing techniques.
## FAQ
- Q: Can AGIBootstrap replace human coders completely? A: AGIBootstrap is designed to assist human coders and automate certain coding tasks. It aims to enhance productivity and efficiency, but it cannot completely replace human coders in all scenarios.
- Q: Can AGIBootstrap handle large-scale codebases? A: AGIBootstrap is designed to handle codebases of varying sizes. It leverages advanced indexing and search techniques to efficiently process large-scale code repositories.
- Q: How does AGIBootstrap handle version control? A: The Codex component of AGIBootstrap provides version control functionality. It integrates with popular version control systems and provides tools for managing code changes and collaboration.
- Q: Can AGIBootstrap generate code from natural language descriptions? A: AGIBootstrap incorporates natural language processing techniques and has the ability to generate code from natural language descriptions. However, the accuracy and reliability of code generation from natural language inputs depend on various factors such as the complexity of the task and the quality of the input description. We hope this document provides a comprehensive understanding of AGIBootstrap and its capabilities. Please refer to the individual package documentation for more detailed information on each component.
