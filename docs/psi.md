# PSI
The PSI (Project Structure Interface) system is a graph-based representation of a file directory system, specifically designed for code files. It provides a comprehensive and organized structure for analyzing and manipulating code data.
## Graph-based representation
The PSI system consists of a graph network, where each file in the directory is represented as a node. The code within each file is treated as a child node connected to its parent file node, forming a hierarchical structure. This allows for easy traversal and analysis of the file directory system.
## Universal Abstract Syntax Tree (UAST)
The PSI system also includes the Universal Abstract Syntax Tree (UAST), which represents the code within each file as an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). Each AST is associated with its parent file node in the PSI graph, capturing the structure and relationships between code elements such as declarations, references, and implementations.
## Node Interface
The PSI system provides a Node interface, which is a fundamental part of the PSI. Every node in the PSI graph implements this interface. It provides methods to access information about the node, such as its parent, children, AST, and comments. Additionally, the Node interface allows for adding and removing nodes from the graph.
## Node Types
The PSI system provides several node types that can be used to represent different elements of code files:
- The psi.Node interface represents a generic node in the PSI graph. It defines methods like Parent(), Children(), Ast(), etc. that can be used to access information about the node.
- The *psi.BaseNode type is a base implementation of the psi.Node interface. It provides common functionality for all PSI nodes.
- The *psi.Container type represents a container node in the PSI graph. It is used to represent code elements that can contain other code elements, like functions, classes, etc.
- The *psi.Leaf type represents a leaf node in the PSI graph. It is used to represent code elements that cannot contain other code elements, like variables, constants, etc.
## Usage
To use the PSI system, first import the `github.com/<username>/psi` module. Then, create a new PSI graph using the `NewGraph()` function. Add nodes representing files and their corresponding ASTs to the graph using the `AddNode()` method. Finally, use the provided methods of the Node interface to explore and analyze the file directory system.
Developers can use the PSI system to efficiently analyze code structures, perform code transformations, and build tools for code refactoring and code generation. Its flexibility and extensibility make it a valuable tool in understanding and manipulating code data.
