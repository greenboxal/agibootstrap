The PSI (Project Structure Interface) system is a graph-based representation of a file directory system, specifically designed for code files. It provides a comprehensive and organized structure for analyzing and manipulating code data.
The PSI system consists of a graph network, where each file in the directory is represented as a node. The code within each file is treated as a child node connected to its parent file node, forming a hierarchical structure. This allows for easy traversal and analysis of the file directory system.
The PSI system also includes the Universal Abstract Syntax Tree (UAST), which represents the code within each file as an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). Each AST is associated with its parent file node in the PSI graph, capturing the structure and relationships between code elements such as declarations, references, and implementations.
To use the PSI system, first import the `github.com/<username>/psi` module. Then, create a new PSI graph using the `NewGraph()` function. Add nodes representing files and their corresponding ASTs to the graph using the `AddNode()` method. Finally, use the provided methods of the Node interface to explore and analyze the file directory system.
Node Types: The PSI system provides several node types that can be used to represent different elements of code files:
- The `psi.Node` interface represents a generic node in the PSI graph. It defines methods like `Parent()`, `Children()`, `Ast()`, etc. that can be used to access information about the node.
With the PSI system, developers can efficiently analyze code structures, perform code transformations, and build tools for code refactoring and code generation. Its flexibility and extensibility make it a valuable tool in understanding and manipulating code data.
