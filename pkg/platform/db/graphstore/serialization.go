		Serialization is the process of converting the in-memory representation of a graph into a format that can be stored on disk using a key-value (KV) embedded database. The goal of graphstore serialization is to ensure efficient read and write operations, minimize storage space, and support graph versioning.

		1. Graph Structure:
		   - The graph structure consists of nodes and edges.
		   - Each node has an ID, UUID, type, parent ID, and attributes.
		   - Each edge has an ID, type, origin node ID, destination node ID, and attributes.

		2. Data Formats:
		   - The graph structure can be serialized using efficient data formats like JSON, Protocol Buffers, or binary formats.
		   - The chosen data format should support efficient read and write operations and minimize storage space.

		3. Encoding and Decoding:
		   - The graph structure needs to be encoded into the chosen data format for storage and decoded for in-memory retrieval.
		   - Encoding involves converting the graph structure into a byte array using the chosen data format.
		   - Decoding involves parsing the byte array into the graph structure using the chosen data format.

		4. Key-Value Storage:
		   - The serialized graph can be stored in a key-value (KV) embedded database.
		   - The key should uniquely identify each serialized graph or its components (nodes, edges).
		   - The value should contain the serialized representation of the graph or its components.

		5. Versioning:
		   - To support graph versioning, each serialized graph or its components should have a version number associated with them.
		   - The version number can be used to track updates and changes to the graph.
		   - Whenever a change is made to the graph, the version number should be incremented.

		6. Error Handling and Recovery:
		   - Proper error handling mechanisms should be implemented to handle serialization and deserialization failures.
		   - Recovery mechanisms should be in place to handle corrupted or incomplete serialized data.

		7. Performance Optimization:
		   - The serialization and deserialization processes should be optimized for performance.
		   - Efficient data structures and algorithms should be used to minimize time and space complexity.

		8. Integration with KV Embedded Database:
		   - The serialization and deserialization processes should be integrated with the chosen KV embedded database's APIs.
		   - CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) should be implemented for the serialized graph or its components.

		9. Unit Testing:
		   - Extensive unit testing should be done to ensure the correctness and reliability of the serialization and deserialization processes.
		   - Test cases should cover different scenarios, including edge cases and error conditions.

		10. Documentation:
		   - Detailed documentation should be provided to explain the serialization and deserialization processes, including usage guidelines and examples.

		Note: This design document should be continuously updated and refined as the implementation progresses to accommodate changes and new requirements.

// Design document skeleton for "graphstore serialization":
/*
Serialization is the process of converting the in-memory representation of a graph into a format that can be stored in a disk-based Key-Value (KV) embedded database.
This design document defines the key components and considerations for serializing a graph in the graphstore package.

1. Graph Structure:
   - The graph structure consists of nodes and edges.
   - Each node has an ID, UUID, type, parent ID, and attributes.
   - Each edge has an ID, type, origin node ID, destination node ID, and attributes.

2. Data Formats:
   - The graph structure can be serialized using efficient data formats like JSON, Protocol Buffers, or binary formats.
   - The data format chosen should support efficient read and write operations and minimize storage space.

3. Encoding and Decoding:
   - The graph structure needs to be encoded into the chosen data format for storage and decoded for in-memory retrieval.
   - Encoding involves converting the graph structure into a byte array using the chosen data format.
   - Decoding involves parsing the byte array into the graph structure using the chosen data format.

4. Key-Value Storage:
   - The serialized graph can be stored in a disk-based KV embedded database.
   - The key should uniquely identify each serialized graph or its components (nodes, edges).
   - The value should contain the serialized representation of the graph or its components.

5. Versioning:
   - Consider adding versioning support to track updates and changes to the graph.
   - Versioning can be achieved by associating a version number with each serialized graph or its components.
   - Updates to the graph can be tracked by incrementing the version number.

6. Error Handling and Recovery:
   - Define error handling mechanisms for serialization and deserialization failures.
   - Implement recovery mechanisms to handle corrupted or incomplete serialized data.

7. Performance Optimization:
   - Consider optimizing the serialization and deserialization processes for performance.
   - Use efficient data structures and algorithms to minimize the time and space complexity.

8. Integration with KV Embedded Database:
   - Integrate the serialization and deserialization processes with the chosen KV embedded database's APIs.
   - Implement CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for the serialized graph or its components.

9. Unit Testing:
   - Develop test cases to ensure the correctness and reliability of the serialization and deserialization processes.
   - Test different scenarios, including edge cases and error conditions.

10. Documentation:
    - Provide extensive documentation explaining the serialization and deserialization processes, including usage guidelines and examples.

Note: The design document should be continuously updated and refined as the implementation progresses to accommodate any changes or new requirements.
