package codex

// # Codex Design Document
//
// <package description here>
//
// ## Overview
//
// The codex package provides functionality for managing projects in Go.
// It includes features for version control, code analysis, and code generation.
// The main components of the codex package are the Project, SourceFile, and BuildStep types.
// The Project type represents a codex project and provides methods for managing project files
// and performing project-wide operations. The SourceFile type represents a source code file and
// provides methods for retrieving and modifying its content. The BuildStep type represents a step
// in the build process and provides methods for processing project files. It can be used to perform
// actions such as code formatting, import fixing, and error checking. The codex package also includes
// utility functions for working with the Go AST and token packages. Overall, the codex package aims to
// simplify the development process and improve code quality in Go projects.
//
// ## Intended Usage
//
// The intended usage of the codex package is to provide a set of tools and utilities for managing and
// analyzing Go projects. The Project type serves as the entry point for accessing and manipulating
// project files. It provides methods for tasks such as adding/removing files, retrieving file contents,
// and performing project-wide operations such as code formatting and error checking.
//
// The SourceFile type represents a single source code file in the project. It offers methods for retrieving
// and modifying the content of the file. This allows users to make changes to the source code programmatically,
// such as refactoring or generating code.
//
// The BuildStep type represents a step in the build process. It provides methods for processing project files
// and performing actions such as code formatting, import fixing, and error checking. Users can define custom
// build steps to be executed in a specific order for a given project.
//
// The codex package aims to simplify the development process by providing a unified and consistent interface
// for managing Go projects. It leverages the power of the Go AST and token packages to analyze and manipulate
// source code, enabling users to automate tasks and improve code quality.
//
// ## Build Steps
//
// The build process in the codex package consists of a series of build steps. Each build step performs a specific
// action on the project's source files. Some common build steps include code formatting, import fixing, and error checking.
// Users can define their own custom build steps to perform project-specific actions or implement additional functionality.
//
// The BuildStep interface defines the contract for a build step. It has a single method, Process, which takes a Project
// as input and returns a BuildStepResult and an error. The Process method is responsible for executing the build step
// logic and returning the result of the build step, along with any error that occurred during the process.
//
// The Project type provides a method called RunBuildSteps, which takes a list of build steps as input and executes them
// in the order specified. This allows users to easily perform multiple build steps in a specific order. Each build step
// is executed in isolation, and the result of each build step is recorded and returned as part of the BuildStepResult.
// If an error occurs during any of the build steps, the process is halted, and the error is returned.
//
// The codex package provides a set of predefined build steps that cover common use cases. However, users can define their
// own custom build steps by implementing the BuildStep interface. This allows for flexibility and customization, as users
// can tailor the build process to their specific requirements.
//
// ## Project
//
// The Project type represents a codex project and provides methods for managing project files and performing project-wide
// operations. It serves as the entry point for working with the project and provides a unified interface for accessing and
// manipulating project files.
//
// The Project type has the following main features:
//
//   - Managing project files: The Project type provides methods for adding, removing, and renaming project files. These methods
//     allow users to modify the structure of the project and keep it in sync with the file system.
//
//   - Retrieving file contents: The Project type allows users to retrieve the contents of a specific file in the project. This
//     makes it easy to read and manipulate the source code of a file programmatically.
//
//   - Performing project-wide operations: The Project type provides methods for performing project-wide operations, such as code
//     formatting, import fixing, and error checking. These operations can be executed on all project files or specific files
//     based on the user's needs.
//
// The Project type is designed to simplify the management of Go projects by providing a high-level API for common tasks. It
// hides the complexity of working with the file system and the Go AST package, allowing users to focus on the task at hand
// without worrying about the implementation details.
