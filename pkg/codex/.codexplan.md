# codex
Package codex provides functionality for managing projects in Go, including version control, code analysis, and code generation. The main components of the codex package are the Project, SourceFile, and BuildStep types. The Project type represents a codex project and provides methods for managing project files and performing project-wide operations. The SourceFile type represents a source code file and provides methods for retrieving and modifying its content. The BuildStep type represents a step in the build process and provides methods for processing project files. It can be used to perform actions such as code formatting, import fixing, and error checking. The codex package also includes utility functions for working with the Go AST and token packages. Overall, the codex package aims to simplify the development process and improve code quality in Go projects.
