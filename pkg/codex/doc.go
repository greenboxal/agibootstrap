// Design Document:
// The codex package provides functionality for managing projects in Go.
// It includes features for version control, code analysis, and code generation.
// The main components of the codex package are the Project, SourceFile, and BuildStep types.
// The Project type represents a codex project and provides methods for managing project files
// and performing project-wide operations. The SourceFile type represents a source code file and
// provides methods for retrieving and modifying its content. The BuildStep type represents a step
// in the build process and provides methods for processing project files. It can be used to perform
// actions such as code formatting, import fixing, and error checking. The codex package also includes
// utility functions for working with the Go AST and token packages. Overall, the codex package aims to
// simplify the development process and improve code quality in Go projects.
