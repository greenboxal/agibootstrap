// # Virtual Type System (VTS)
// VTS is a generic type system that can be used to represent any type of data structure.
// It's flexible enough to represent any type of data structure found in Go.
// All data structures are represented as a tree of nodes.
// References are tracked as edges in the tree.
// A Scope is a tree of nodes that represents a unit of code, like a package, module, etc.
// A Scope can be used to represent a single file, a package, a module, or even a project.
// # VTS Node
// A VTS node represents a node in the type system tree.
// It's the building block of the VTS hierarchy.
// A VTS node can represent various types, such as a struct, interface, function, etc.
// # VTS Edge
// A VTS edge represents a reference between two VTS nodes.
// It's used to establish relationships between the nodes in the VTS tree.
// An edge can represent various types of relationships, such as an embedding, implementation, etc.
// # VTS Scope
// A VTS scope represents a unit of code in the VTS tree.
// It can represent a file, package, module, or even a project.
// A scope can contain multiple nodes and edges.
// # VTS Package
// A VTS package is a special type of scope that represents a Go package.
// It can contain its own set of nodes and edges, and can also import other packages.
// # VTS File
// A VTS file is a special type of scope that represents a Go file.
// It can contain its own set of nodes and edges, and is usually part of a package.
// # VTS Node Type
// A VTS node type represents the type of a VTS node.
// It defines the properties and behaviors of the node.
// Common node types include struct, interface, function, etc.
// # VTS Edge Type
// A VTS edge type represents the type of a VTS edge.
// It defines the relationship between two VTS nodes.
// Common edge types include embedding, implementation, etc.
// # VTS Query
// A VTS query is used to query the VTS tree for specific nodes or edges.
// It provides a way to search and traverse the VTS tree based on certain criteria.
