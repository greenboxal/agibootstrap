// # Virtual Type System (VTS)
// VTS is a generic type system that can be used to represent any type of data structure.
// It's flexible enough to represent any type of data structure found in Go.
// All data structures are represented as a tree of nodes.
// References are tracked as edges in the tree.
// A Scope is a tree of nodes that represents a unit of code, like a package, module, etc.
// A Scope can be used to represent a single file, a package, a module, or even a project.
