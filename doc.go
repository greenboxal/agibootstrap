package readme

// Package readme provides documentation about how the codex, psi, fti, and gpt packages work together.

// Package Structure:
// AGIBootstrap is a self-bootstrapped artificial general intelligence (AGI) system designed for general coding tasks.
// The codex package provides functionality for managing projects in Go, including version control, code analysis, and code generation.
// The psi package provides a graph-based representation of a file directory system, with a focus on code files.
// The fti package is responsible for indexing file-based repositories using embedding vectors.
// The gpt package is designed to work with the GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) language model.

// Usage:
// To use AGIBootstrap, you can import and use the various packages as needed.
// For example, you can use the codex package for managing Go projects, the psi package for analyzing the file directory system,
// the fti package for indexing file repositories, and the gpt package for working with the GPT language model.

// Integration:
// The codex, psi, fti, and gpt packages can work together to provide a comprehensive set of tools for managing and analyzing Go projects.
// The codex package can be used to initialize and manage Go projects, the psi package can provide a graph-based representation of the project's file directory system,
// the fti package can be used to index the files in the repository using embedding vectors, and the gpt package can be used for intelligent code generation based on the indexed files.

// Usage Example:
// To use AGIBootstrap, import the required packages and use their features accordingly.
// For example, you can use the codex package to manage Go projects, the psi package to analyze the file directory system,
// the fti package to index file repositories, and the gpt package for intelligent code generation.
